## Application
The Innsbruck 'Golden Gate' surface ion trap is a segmented chip trap designed for ion-shuttling-assisted quantum computing. The trap features 55 individual DC segments and a through-chip slot for optical addressing of ion qubits and backside loading. A predecessor of the trap has been used to demonstrate coherent rotations of qubits [[1]](#references).

## Background
The trap was designed by Martin van Mourik in 2018, built by Translume [3] (see [Suppliers](#suppliers)), and has been successfully commissioned in the same year at the EQUAL experiment at the [ion trapping group of Rainer Blatt](https://quantumoptics.at/en/), Innsbruck University. The electrode design is based on proven designs from the [ion trapping group of Hartmut Häffner](https://ions.berkeley.edu/), University of Berkeley, described in Refs. [[1,2]](#references).

## Technical approach
The Innsbruck 'Golden Gate' trap, depicted in the figure below, consists of 27 pairs of individually addressable electrodes, a central electrode, and central rf rails. The electrode pairs have a length of 100 μm along z. The central electrode has a width of 30 µm (along x), and the rf rails have a width of 60 µm. The slot width is 100 µm. All electrodes are separated by 10 μm wide and 50 µm deep trenches. The electrode layout yields an ion trapping position 110 μm above the trap plane, and a 121 μm ion-electrode separation. Ion crystals are oriented along the z-axis, and the rf rails produce a confining pseudopotential in the xy-plane.

Figure: Overview of the electrode layout of the Innsbruck 'Golden Gate' trap. The cross section view at the right end of the chip shows the tapered through-chip slot. Between the segment leads are markers used for identification of the trap region relative to the imaging field of view. The total chip dimensions are $$9\times4.5\times0.5\,\text{mm}^3$$.

## Technical drawings
- A [technical drawing](supplemental_material/ibk_Golden-Gate-trap_layout.PDF) with overall dimensions of the trap chip is available in pdf format.
- The full [3D model](supplemental_material/ibk_Golden-Gate-trap_layout.STEP) of  the trap is available in STEP format.

## Trap simulation output
- [Spherical harmonics expansion coefficients](supplemental_material/multipole_coeffs.txt) for the DC electrodes 1-27 as labelled in the figure below. The expansion coefficients are evaluated at the trap centre, marked with a red cross in the figure below, and assuming 1 volt is applied to the respective electrode. The coefficients are consistent with the spherical harmonics expansion in the [ion-trap-related definitions](../definitions_ion-traps.md). Note that the 1st order coefficients $$C_{1,j}$$ have unit 1/mm while the 2nd order coefficients $$C_{2,j}$$ have unit  1/mm². 
- [List of voltages](supplemental_material/multipole_voltages.txt) required to generate a specific spherical harmonic potential. The voltages are sorted consistently with the electrode labelling in the figure below.

## Suppliers
The fused silica trap substrate was patterned by Translume [3] using a combination of pulsed-laser glass weakening and hydrofluoric acid etching.

## Assembly
The patterned substrate was gold-coated in the cleanroom facilities in Innsbruck with an e-beam evaporator.
Prior to coating the trap was rinsed with deionized water and blow-dried with nitrogen. For the coating, about 10 nm Ti (as adhesion promoter) and 150 nm gold was applied under two different evaporation directions per chip side, as illustrated in the figure below: Evaporation angle 1 is found by rotating the surface normal by 45° around the z-axis, followed by a -45° rotation around the y-axis. Evaporation angle 2 is found by a -45° rotation around the z-axis, followed by a -45° rotation around the y-axis. Both the top and bottom side of the trap were coated from these two directions. The resulting metallic coating is thus a sequence of Ti-Au-Ti-Au, with a total thickness of about 226 nm. The evaporation chamber had to be vented in between the individual coating steps to change the coating direction, i.e. in total 4 evaporation runs were needed.

The coated trap was glued onto an interposer PCB and its electrodes were wire bonded to electrical supply leads, for details see the [Innsbruck Golden Gate trap mount](../../mounts/ibk-GoldenGate_TrapMount/GoldenGate_trap_mount.md). Subsequently, the trap was inserted in the vacuum chamber without additional cleaning steps.

## Experience and further comments
The general behaviour of the trap is good, with basically infinite Doppler-cooled lifetimes for single species ion crystals ($$^{40}\mathrm{Ca}^{+}$$ or $$^{88}\mathrm{Sr}^{+}$$). Storage and control of ion motion of mixed species crystals requires careful control of voltage ramps and stray field compensation; a deeper trapping potential might be useful there. A similar experience in trap operability (stray charges, heating rate, etc.) has been made in the past with predecessors of the trap, having slightly different electrode geometry but identical fabrication method.
